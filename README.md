# Machine Learning Projects ðŸ’»
Few Machine Learning and AI themed projects  using Python 3.7 and its libraries, such as:
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV
- BeautifulSoup
- Selentium
- Seaborn
- Pyttsx
- Gym
- YOLO
- IBM
- Pytorch
- Pygame

All of the projects here are based on online tutorials or official documentation.

----------------------------------
## CHATGPT
Simple implementation and usage of the ChatGPT model. Using gradio to create your own chatbot.

## CHATBOT
Basic chatbot, that you can use on your website.

## DEEP LEARNING
A bunch of notes on Deep Learning, AI and Machine Learning.

## DETECTORS
Detecting various items on images (includes exoplanet hunting project, as well as commentary and implementation of hand gesture recognizer).

## GAN
Generative adversarial network (GAN) projects.

## INTERVIEW NOTES
Various useful notes. Helpful when getting ready for Machine Learning interviews.

## KNN
Various projects dedicated for exploring sklearn library and popular Machine Learning algorithms such as K Nearest Neighbours (KNN).

## LIBRARIES
Trying out various Machine Learning libraries (Altair, Bokeh, Datapane, etc).

## MAMMO PROJECT
Mammography project. Detecting breast cancer with Neural Networks.

## MOBILEDEV
Development and deployment of mobile applications coded in Python.

## NOTES
TODO

## OPENCV(2)
Experimenting with filters, haar cascades, timelapses. Video and photo features.

## PATHFINDING
A* Pathfinding algorithm.

## POSE ESTIMATION
Using YOLO library to main points on human body.

## PYTORCH
Few projects just to get familiar with PyTorch library.

## QUANTPRO
Quantitative programming using IBM Python supporting library.

## R
Few projects just to get familiar with R language, syntax, possibilities and R Studio.

## REINFORCEMENT
Reinforcement Learning projects tested with gym library and its environments.

## SCRATCH
TODO

## SELF-DRIVING CARS
Computer Vision and CARLA projects.

## SKLEARN
Few projects just to get familiar with the Sklearn library.

## SNAKE
Snake game made with PyGame. Implemented ML algorithms to help the app learn the game rules and high scores.

## SOUND RELATED
Projects related mostly with voice recognition; e.g. a voice assistant similiar to f. e. Alexa, converting PDF to Audiobook format with pyttsx3 library

## SUDOKU
Sudoku game made with PyGame. Implemented self-solving recursive algorithm.

## SUMMARY
Document summarization with Sklearn and Deep Learning.

## TENSORFLOW
TODO

## VIRUSES
Exploring the way that viruses work and how they are programmed (white hat hacking).

## VIZUALISATIONS
Exploring Seaborn, Matplotlib's plots and Panda's plots. Lots of data vizualisations (who would have guessed).

## WEB SCRAP
Scraping websites with Selentium and Beautiful Soup.
